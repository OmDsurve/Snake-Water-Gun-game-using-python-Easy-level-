# Snake-Water-Gun-game-using-python-Easy-level-

This Python script implements a simple "Snake, Water, Gun" game where:

- The computer randomly selects one of three options: Snake (`1`), Water (`-1`), or Gun (`0`).
- The user inputs their choice, which is mapped to these options.
- The script displays both the user's and computer's choices.
- It then determines the winner based on the rules of the game:
  - Snake beats Water
  - Water beats Gun
  - Gun beats Snake
- The result of the game (win, lose, or draw) is printed accordingly.
